# This parameters control the amount we should slither. Any pixel value which
# is higher (lighter) than maxval_note_pixal by this fraction.
# Increase this value to create larger notes. But you wont be able to get shart
# discontinuities between pixels. Must be larger than 1.0, 
# 
# Things gets very sensitive to this value. Be careful when using it. Larger
# value of this parameter detects many possible notes. Bottomline and topline
# tests usually rejects them. Moreover, too small value of this parameter might
# give us sharper notes but each note is computed many time for each notes might
# have discontinuties for this given value.
#
# IF WIENER FILTER IS USED THEN INCREASE IT TO 1.25 which is a decent value. Any
# value less than 1.2 is most likely to produce repetetive notes which are way
# too close to be called separated notes.
